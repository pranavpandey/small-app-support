*A simple library to build apps for Sony Small Apps Extension.*

Small App Support is an easy to use library to build attractive small apps with native apps like functionality. I have divided it into different parts for easy understanding. As small app is a service there was a problem displaying a dialog from the small app. So, I have wrote a function to easily display a dialog from a small app. This library is a collection of such type of functions and classes to provide a good interface.
